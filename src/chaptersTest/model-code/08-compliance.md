# Compliance and Enforcement


## Inspections

1. After the initial inspection for purposes of determining permit eligibility, a HOME COOKING OPERATION shall be subject to inspections only in the following three circumstances: 
    1. Not more than once in any twelve-month period, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY may conduct a routine inspection for the purpose of observing the operator engaged in the usual activities of a HOME COOKING OPERATION, including, but not limited to, active food preparation. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall provide notice to the PERMIT HOLDER before a routine inspection and shall conduct the routine inspection at a mutually agreeable date and time. This paragraph shall not be deemed to require the REGULATORY AUTHORITY to conduct a routine inspection.
    2. A for-cause inspection may be conducted when the REGULATORY AUTHORITY has a valid reason, such as a credible consumer complaint, to suspect that adulterated or otherwise unsafe food has been produced by the HOME COOKING OPERATION or that the HOME COOKING OPERATION has otherwise been in  violation of this Code. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall provide notice to an operator before conducting a for-cause inspection and shall conduct the inspection at a mutually agreeable date and time.
    3. If the REGULATORY AUTHORITY has just cause to believe that the HOME COOKING OPERATION poses a serious hazard or immediate threat to public health, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY may conduct an emergency inspection that is limited to the facts prompting the inspection. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall provide the operator with notice of an emergency inspection to the extent that it is reasonable to do so under the circumstances.
2. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY may decline to grant a new PERMIT, may decline to renew a PERMIT, and may suspend or revoke a PERMIT already granted after due notice and opportunity for hearing whenever it finds that:
    1. Any statement contained in an application for a license is or was false or misleading;
    2. The HOME COOKING OPERATION does not have facilities or EQUIPMENT sufficient to maintain adequate sanitation for the activities conducted;
    3. The HOME COOKING OPERATION is not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition or is not operated in a sanitary manner;
    4. The maintenance and operation of the HOME COOKING OPERATION is such that the food produced therein is or may be ADULTERATED;
    5. The HOME COOKING OPERATION has failed or refused to produce any records or provide any information demanded by the REGULATORY AUTHORITY reasonably related to the administration and enforcement of this Code; or
    6. The HOME COOKING OPERATION has failed to comply with any of the provisions of this Code.

## Investigation After Complaint

1. A for-cause or emergency inspection of a HOME COOKING OPERATION may include:
    1. Examination, sampling, and testing of FOOD to determine if the FOOD was misbranded or ADULTERATED;
    2. Interviews regarding the health of the COOKS to determine if the COOKS:
        1. have possibly transmitted disease; or
        2. may be a carrier of infectious agents that cause a disease that is transmissible through FOOD; or
        3. are affected with a boil, an infected wound, or acute respiratory infection. 


## Permit suspension, revocation, nonrenewal

1. If the REGULATORY AUTHORITY suspends, revokes, or declines to renew a permit, it must provide the PERMIT HOLDER an order within five (5) business days, that includes:
    1. List of violations with explanations and instructions on how to cure the violations; 
    2. The name and address of the REGULATORY AUTHORITY representative to whom a request for an appeal hearing may be made. 
2. The regulatory authority shall reinstate a suspended HOME COOKING OPERATION PERMIT when the conditions causing the permit suspension are no longer present.


## RESTRICTION or EXCLUSION of a COOK

1. If the REGULATORY AUTHORITY issues a RESTRICTION or EXCLUSION order to a COOK who is suspected of being infected or diseased, or suspends a HOME COOKING OPERATION PERMIT based on the findings of an investigation related to a COOK who is suspected of being infected or diseased, it must provide the PERMIT HOLDER an order within five (5) business days, that includes:
    1. The reasons for the order;
    2. The evidence that the COOK or PERMIT HOLDER shall provide lift the RESTRICTION or the PERMIT suspension order and instructions on how to reinstate the PERMIT; and
    3. The name and address of the REGULATORY AUTHORITY representative to whom a request for an appeal hearing may be made.
2. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall release a COOK from RESTRICTION or EXCLUSION when the conditions causing the RESTRICTION or EXCLUSION are no longer present.


## Emergency Health Hazards: Ceasing Operations, Reporting, and Resuming Operations

1. Except as specified in (B) of this section, a PERMIT HOLDER shall immediately discontinue operations and notify the REGULATORY AUTHORITY if an imminent health hazard may exist because of an emergency such as a fire, flood, extended interruption of electrical or water service, sewage backup, misuse of poisonous or toxic materials, onset of an apparent FOODborne illness outbreak, gross insanitary occurrence or condition, or other circumstance that may endanger public health.
2. A PERMIT HOLDER need not discontinue operations in an area of an HOME COOKING OPERATION that is unaffected by the imminent health hazard.
3. If operations are discontinued as specified under (A) or otherwise according to law, the permit holder shall obtain approval from the REGULATORY AUTHORITY before resuming operations.

## Penalties for Violations of the Home Cooking Operation Chapter

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and except in circumstances posing an imminent, serious risk to public health, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall issue a warning letter or notice of violation to any person it finds to be in violation of this chapter or the regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, and provide the alleged violator a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation, before the REGULATORY AUTHORITY seeks an administrative remedy or penalty. Agency and local authority enforcement powers shall be limited to investigations, inspections, warnings, and restrictions, suspensions or revocations of a permit.
