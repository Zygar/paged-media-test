### Introduction
International space law, or what the community of space jurists calls the  _corpus juris spatialis_, consists of international binding rules which apply to governmental entities. The main body of international space law is the Outer Space Treaty (OST) of 1967 (1), which is a treaty of principles[^1] such as,  _inter alia_, benefit sharing, free exploration, equal access, due regard, non-harmful interference, and cooperation. Since its creation, the OST has achieved global consensus and ensured the peaceful use of outer space. However, circumstances are changing as the space sector grows commercially and the role of non-governmental entities becomes more prominent (2). In fact, article VI of the OST -- which provides that States must supervise the activities of non-governmental actors from their respective jurisdiction and that therefore the OST indirectly applies to these private entities through national space legislation -- seems not to suffice anymore (3). Indeed, it leads to fragmentation and issues such as “forum shopping” (4) whereby non-governmental actors seek to incorporate their entities within more permissive jurisdictions, enhancing thus the divisiveness of international legal standards and norms (5). Furthermore, this accelerated privatization dynamic is not only caused by a race towards the acquisition of space resources, but on a new interpretation of article VI of the OST which emerges as an adaptive mechanism, opening opportunities for further regulation on commercial space when needed, through national law (6).

### Commercial Space Law Context
Given the context  _supra_, the observed trend is that a growing number of divergent national laws are fragmenting the main international body of space law to protect domestic geopolitical and commercial interests (7). The legal void contained within international space law gave enough room to States to further regulate the commercial activities of their nationals according to their interests, under the condition that these national legislations comply with the applicable law and the rules of interpretation of international treaties (8). However, it is debated today whether certain legislations are departing from these requirements and, interestingly, there seems to be no right or wrong answer as we simply tread into unknown legal territory (9). To illustrate this point, the example of the non-appropriation principle, enshrined within article II of the OST, can be used (10). Conventionally, it is considered that no State can claim sovereignty over celestial bodies or their resources. However, nothing is mentioned as to the commercial appropriation of such resources and some States, such as the United States, Luxembourg, the United Arab Emirates (11) chose to grant rights to space resources to their nationals while there is no consensus at the international level on this issue (12). One of the main obstacles to a consensus is that, besides the non-appropriation principle, there is no other space property rights regime in place, nor are there any definitions related to property law which would be useful in that sense. For instance, there is no definition of a “celestial body”, of “movable” or “immovable” goods in space, nor is there any universally adopted legal definition of a “space object” or “space resources” (13). Most interestingly, as the legal debate continues on the legal void at the international level, and while “fragmented” national law creates a heterogenous puzzle of legal loopholes (e.g., assignment, attribution or jurisdiction matters, etc.), the private sector moves fast enough to seize the opportunity to create “customary” practice and make its own rules (14). This phenomenon can be described as the rise of the  _“lex mercatoria spatialis”_  (15) (or commercial space law), which, contrary to the  _corpus juris spatialis_, evolves rather quickly in a “stealthy” fashion and is more elusive given that commercial law is not international, but transnational (16). Transnational law is more flexible and multifaceted, it is therefore harder to grasp. For example, with regards to property rights, what makes its international harmonization inherently trickier is that property law is linked to a national jurisdiction. However, as soon as some property rights are transformed into financial assets, they escape a given jurisdiction and fall under transnational law (17). For this reason, this note addresses property rights in further sections, more precisely through the prism of space resources, finance, and intellectual property rights, while ensuring that, for the benefit of a sustainable space ecosystem, monopolies will be limited to the greatest extent possible. In particular, anti-monopoly law is studied at two levels: the what and the how. The what consists in the value proposition of ethical space commerce, compliant with fair competition principles, and the how consists in the means to ensure that those means do not monopolize the final frontier.

### **Problem**
This changing context raises the question of whether public international space law is well equipped to face the rampant transnational  _lex mercatoria spatialis_  dynamic, or whether new cross-national actors are playing an increasing role in private international law, and in the privatization of law itself, with regards to the development of the future space ecosystem. This begs the question as to the means of ensuring the (perennial) protection of the higher principles and ethics of international space law despite the sector’s privatization.**‍**

### **Potential Solutions**  
There are multiple potential legal solutions at the international level, such as amending the OST. However, interestingly, the private sector is not that keen on changing the OST (18). Moreover, reaching global consensus has proved increasingly more challenging (19) given the growing number of space faring nations or nations with space capabilities (20), non-traditional space actors (21), the democratization of the space sector (22), and the fragmentation of space law (23). Therefore, for efficient and pragmatic reasons, a solution at the global governance level, such as the United Nations (24), is not necessarily ideal for the near future (25), nor for the commercial sector which prefers to “pick and choose” among the most advantageous jurisdictions following their interests, to the detriment of globalized legal stability (26). Moreover, it is asserted that new elements of the body of law are created behind closed doors, privately, by lawyers and arbitrators, and not publicly, by judges (27). Notably, since the private sector appears lately to be one step ahead of regulators in the emerging space commerce (28), it would make sense to look at adopting strategies that resonate with the commercial sector to anticipate the next moves while not just regulating for the sake of it (29). Instead, to secure the perennialism of the higher principles of space law, it would be beneficial to create legal (either hard or soft law) “beacons” as catalysts for future ethical compliance, in terms of requirements, incentives and sanctions, and thus help channel the market forces into a sustainable direction in the interest of intergenerational benefit sharing (30). Legal design (31), as elaborated in the discussion section, _infra_, comes in as a useful tool to mind map a constellation of legal loopholes and contention points to be “transformed” and “activated” into such ethical compliance beacons (32) by co-design at a later stage. Such a visual tool can indeed contribute to determining better strategies and roadmaps down the road.

### **Analysis of the What: Antitrust and the OST Principles**
One such strategy could stem from the realm of national law, even though it can trigger international implications and consequences. In this case, it is not about national space legislation, but about competition law, or what is also called antitrust. The only reason why antitrust is considered at his stage, is that antitrust stems from the national level and that there is no such thing, to this day, as a harmonized international antitrust regime  _per se_  besides a fragile international governance consisting of non-binding guidelines (33) and failed dialogue at the level of the World Trade Organization (WTO) (34). Antitrust is indeed very much politicized (35) and arbitrary, judged on a case-by-case basis, and at the service of “national champions” (36). However, despite these hurdles, several arguments can be made in favor of antitrust mechanisms applied to the commercial space sector for the benefit of protecting the aforementioned principles to prevent a zero-sum dynamic (37).

#### **Benefit Sharing**  
Firstly, fair competition entails preventing further consolidation of a market and breaking up monopolies which absorb most benefits in one place (38). In the space sector, the 1966 Declaration on Space Benefits (39) and the OST emphasize the need for space activities to be “carried out for the benefit” of humankind. Indeed, article I of the OST, provides that:  

> “The **exploration and use of outer space**, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the  **benefit and in the interests of all countries**, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind (...)” (emphasis added)  

However, it is not clear how space activities are exactly to be carried out for the benefit of all. The notion of “sharing” benefits derived from space activities appears in the Moon Agreement of 1979 but the agreement itself has not succeeded in being adopted by a significant number of nations and its fate remains uncertain (40). However, the notion of benefit “sharing” has resurfaced through international working groups such as the Hague International Space Resources Governance Working Group (HIRSGWG) and debated by scholars at Outer Space Institute (OSI) in terms of what benefit sharing should entail (41). What is clear, though, is that more work must be done to determine what the notion of benefits entails, and an antitrust perspective might be helpful in terms of promoting fair competition while restricting unchecked consolidation. More work must also determine whether equality or equity (or both, and if so, to what extent) should prevail.

#### **Equality and Free Access**  

Secondly, it could be argued that the principle of “equality” and “free access” as enshrined within article I of the OST would seem to preclude monopolies insofar as equal access to celestial bodies must be maintained while, in theory, monopolization would potentially bar such equal access:  

> (...) Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all States without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of  **equality**  and in accordance with international law, and there shall be  **free access**  to all areas of **celestial bodies**  (...) (42). (emphasis added)

The main concern raised by the above-cited paragraph is to determine to what extent the article I applies to space resources on the celestial bodies in question. Since celestial bodies are not defined, as previously stated, and since there is no mention of space “resources” within the OST, national law or doctrine can be used to answer the question. The only national legislations mentioning space resources are the ones in favor of the commercialization, as listed  _supra_ (43). Secondary sources, or doctrine, reflect divergent views expressed by scholars at the international level (44). This situation illustrates how national law is filling the legal void previously referred to. Nevertheless, which void does it precisely try to fill? The term “appropriation” appears in article II of the OST, alongside with the term “celestial body” which, in article I appears next to “free access”, “equality” and “benefit”. By association, it can be inferred that the States in favor of space commerce do not object to the idea of the extension of these principles to space resources. In this case, as space resources regulation seems to emanate from the national level, national antitrust measures constitute, (at the first stage) an adequate legal response, in parallel, to contain and monitor the risk of monopolization or other anti-competitive behavior in space (an international level field). Such measures could indeed be included within current and future national space legislation and enforce fair competition based on the OST principles. This could in turn generate enough momentum and critical mass to trigger an international framework and intensify harmonization efforts (at the second stage), especially with regards to the commercialization of the space sector.

#### **Cooperation and Due Regard**  

Thirdly, article IX of the OST provides that principles such as “cooperation” and “due regard” must be complied with:  

> In the exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies,  **States** Parties to the Treaty shall be **guided**  by the principle of **cooperation**  and mutual assistance and  **shall conduct all their activities** in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, with **due regard** to the corresponding i**nterests of all other States**  Parties to the Treaty (45) (emphasis added)  

These obligations, under international law, bind States directly and non-governmental entities, indirectly, because of article VI which extends the State’s responsibility to the activities of their respective nationals. However, as “due regard” may be interpreted as mandatory because of the wording “shall conduct” which precedes it, the same rationale might not necessarily cover cooperation because the wording “shall be guided” might rather lead towards the realm of guidelines. Monopolization tends to preclude cooperation, but it is harder to draw the line between what might consist of cooperation (46) vs collusion (47). “Cooperation” in this case represents an interesting “beacon” because if not carefully delimited, it might lead to a legal void and be used to justify some form of collusion in the future. Therefore, this is a useful example to bring forth ethics and values in the light of the OST principles towards “guiding” interpretation of “cooperation” in compliance with fair competition requirements. Mandatory “due regard” is a key argument backing fair competition due to its definition: “to give a fair consideration to and give sufficient attention to all of the facts” (48). In article IX, “due regard” extends to the interests of “all” other States Parties to the OST, which means that all these interests should be taken into “fair consideration” before conducting activities in outer space. It is difficult to imagine how a monopolistic environment, or any other anti-competitive behavior would come to terms with this norm.
‍
#### **Non-Harmful Interference and Equitable Access/Distribution**  

Fourthly, international space law, thanks to article IX of the OST and international telecommunications law, owing to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), both share an important principle which is non-interference that is a major pillar of space activities. On the one hand, article XI continues as follows:  

> (...) If a  **State Party**  to the Treaty has reason to believe that an  **activity or experiment planned**  by it or its  **nationals**  in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause  **potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space,**  including the Moon and other celestial bodies, it  **shall undertake appropriate international consultations before proceeding with any such activity**  or experiment. A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by  **another State Party**  in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause  **potentially harmful interference with activities**  in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies,  **may request consultation concerning the activity**  or experiment. (emphasis added)

When applied to the fair competition lens, this implies that prior to commercial activities which might result in limiting other nations or nationals’ activities, to the point of potentially “interfering” with their current or prospective activities, States shall conduct consultations or basically notify one another. The enforcement of these consultations remains however uncertain. Nevertheless, the legal obligation remains, and represents, at least in theory, an opportunity for antitrust to set forth recommendations and precedents.

On the other hand, the ITU’s Constitution forbids “harmful interference” in its article 45 (49), but in this case, it defines “harmful interference” in more technical terms, confined to telecommunications:

> “Interference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radiocommunication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations” (50).

However, it is inferred that non-harmful interference is relevant to fair competition, with regards to radio spectrum frequencies management and orbital slot allocation, due to the frequent reference to “equitable geographical distribution”, “equitable use” (article 12), and “equitable access” (article 44) which states the following:

“In using frequency bands for radio services, Member States shall bear in mind that  **radio**  **frequencies and any associated orbits**, including the geostationary-satellite orbit, are  **limited natural resources**  and that they must be  **used rationally, efficiently and economically,**  in conformity with the provisions of the Radio Regulations, so that countries or groups of countries may have  **equitable access to those orbits and frequencies,**  taking into account the  **special needs of the developing countries**  and the geographical situation of particular countries”. (emphasis added)

Equitable access to limited natural resources has also been interpreted by legal scholars as amounting to a fair competition principle (51) and this would add to the argument against potential monopolization of space resources. Furthermore, despite the increasing privatization of the telecommunications sector (52), there remains the obligation to ensure that “fair competition” is adhered to, as in the case of Intelsat (53).

Still, what is to be considered as more problematic is the national interpretation of the principle of non-harmful interference in the sense that it is not clear to what extent national legislation is ready to apply “reciprocity” as implied within article IX of the OST whereby States shall not “interfere” with each other’s activities, and if there is a risk of harmful interference, they must enter into consultation. For instance, one such national law is the US Space Act of 2015 (54) which, in section 402 relative to space resources utilization, provides that the President is directed by the bill to:

> (...) promote the  **right of U.S. citizens to engage in commercial exploration**  for and commercial  **recovery of space resources**  **free from harmful interference**, in accordance with such obligations and subject to authorization and continuing supervision by the federal government. (emphasis added)

The only instance where “reciprocity” is mentioned within the OST is in article XII whereby installations and equipment are to be open to other States on a basis of reciprocity, due notice, and no interference with the facilities’ operations. It might then be inferred that non-interference is of a reciprocal nature and that this interpretation would take precedence over the US Space Act of 2015 which must comply with international applicable law (55). Otherwise, if the US Space Act of 2015 does not recognize the reciprocal nature of non-interference access to and/or recovery of space resources, it would advocate for an extremely competitive environment which would result in challenging the higher principles which the OST fundamentally relies on. This legal contention points to another example for space antitrust “beacons”, channeling prospective space commerce through reciprocal dynamics and non-interfering forces. In this case, what might clarify the perspective of the US is the wording found in bilateral agreements such as the 2020 Artemis Accords (56). Indeed, section 11 on “Deconfliction of Space Activities” (57) elaborates on “due regard” and “non-harmful interference” under the form of “safety zones” (58), while committing to the OST (59). Section 11.3 of the Accords further reiterate the bilateral agreement’s commitment to article IX of the OST and its implied reciprocity:

> **Consistent with Article IX** of the Outer Space Treaty,  **a Signatory** authorizing an activity under these Accords commits to  **respect the principle of due regard.**  A  **Signatory**  to these Accords with **reason to believe that it may suffer, or has suffered, harmful interference**, may  **request consultations**  with a Signatory or any other Party to the Outer Space Treaty authorizing the activity (60). (emphasis added)  

Furthermore, the implied reciprocity is emphasized in section 4:  

> The Signatories  **commit**  to  **seek to refrain from any intentional actions that may create harmful interference with each other’s use of outer space in their activities**  under these Accords.

In short, it can be posited that reciprocal non-harmful interference (or no interference), as referenced  _supra_, complies with fair competition principles in that it might be interpreted as a barrier to monopolization attempts with regards to,  _inter alia_, space resources. This leads the analysis to contemplate antitrust as a potentially satisfactory solution to reach regulatory targets into a growingly transnationalist arena surrounding commercial imperatives. A “space antitrust” framework would require a mandate to make sure that these commercial imperatives thrive for the benefit of the higher principles within space law, which distinguish outer space from most other domains.**‍**

‍

### **Anti-monopoly Law**

Antitrust, as a field of law  _per se_, differs across national jurisdictions. On the one hand, in Europe, it merged into a transnational “continental” framework following the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (61). Success, however, remains limited due to divergent national interpretations and interests, and due to some of the articles’ wording perceived as controversial (62). European competition law considers anti-competitive behavior through abuse of dominance, collusion, concerted practice and cartelization and focuses on the consumer’s welfare while seeking to protect competition  _per se_  as opposed to protecting competitors. Competition law at the European level starts with article 101(1) of the TFEU which prohibits:

> "All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between member states and which have as their object or effect the  **prevention, restriction or distortion of competition**  within the common market." (63) (emphasis added)

On the other hand, on the other side of the Atlantic, in the US, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (64), the Clayton Act of 1914 (65) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), also created in 1914, mostly oppose artificial monopolies (66), anti-competitive or deceptive behavior under the condition that there is an anti-competitive action leading to such an outcome. For instance, section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act provides that any contract or conspiracy to restrict trade is illegal. Furthermore, on monopolization, section 2 provides that:

> Every person who  **shall monopolize**, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a **felony**  (...) (67) (emphasis added)  

This explains why certain scholars (68) refer to US antitrust as, among others, “anti-monopoly” law. At the very beginning, it was used to break monopolizing trusts, in a serial fashion, but in time, it lost its momentum. According to Posner (69), monopolies can be either natural (which the Sherman Act refers to as “innocent monopolies”, to be allowed as legal” or artificial (illegal). Natural monopolies enable, in theory, massive economies of scale and are therefore permitted. Artificial monopolies, on the contrary, are detrimental to the economy as they seek to distort and restrict trade, and they are to be therefore prohibited. Such was the argument of SpaceX in its antitrust battle vs United States Alliance (ULA) when it stated that ULA did not in fact enable such economies of scale and that SpaceX could provide launching services at a cheaper price. Nonetheless, in reality, it is hard to draw the line since antitrust authorities pretend to favor consumer welfare (low prices), but it is hard to distinguish whether low prices are indeed aimed at the final consumer or, in fact, to disqualify competitors thanks to predatory pricing.

### **Space Antitrust**

The extrapolation of anti-monopoly law to outer space (e.g., on orbit, on celestial bodies, etc.), raises the question as to which jurisdiction applies. In theory, the launching State’s jurisdiction extends to the launched space object, in perpetuity, such as in the case of the International Space Station’s modules. However, in many cases, there can be confusion in determining the “launching State”, which is defined at article I of the Liability Convention of 1972 (70), especially when several States are involved in the launching, as opposed to the “State of Registry”, according to article VIII of the OST and the Registration Convention of 1976. Sometimes, the two notions collide head-on (71). The situation gains in further legal complexity in connection with on-orbit transfer of ownership vs title. It is not clear whether ownership can be fully transferred in orbit, as opposed to title, which does not. This may prove over-complicated indeed. Therefore, it would be next to impossible to assign or attribute antitrust to a specific jurisdiction in space and that explains the need for a harmonized outer space regime in terms of antitrust, even more when the principles addressed  _supra_  stem from international public law. Otherwise, different antitrust regimes would then apply to different sites of activity by different actors, which could end up in aberrant scenarios.

It would be more convenient to establish a predictable and harmonious legal certainty, appropriate for each resource system or specific application in outer space and to consider antitrust as a creative tool, not an end in itself. The rationale is to rely on competition law to ensure market sustainability, while reducing the risk of fierce and unfair competition. For instance, in the case of scarce resources (e.g., polar ice water on the Moon), essential services (e.g., oxygen supply on a station, etc.), there is a need for measures against reckless monopolization based on a “first come, first served” logic. As mentioned  _supra_, due regard and non-harmful interference may be used in that sense, but implementation remains to be established. Should that be brought to public international bodies, in the form of binding measures or non-binding guidelines? Should recommendations be made at the national level (e.g., model law clauses (72) to be inserted as amendments to national space legislation? Without harmonization efforts at that level, there is a risk of increasing forum shopping whereby a private actor seeks to register its activities in jurisdictions with less stringent legislation and dubious enforcement resources. This trend starts in the space sector and this is alarming since space is a high risk sector and launching States’ international liability is a complex notion in terms of attribution, especially if the damage takes place in orbit which explains why some private entities either choose a complex forum architecture, mostly through contractual law (73), or try to escape any national jurisdiction altogether by launching from international waters (74), which is considered as yet another example of legal void and deserves more consideration.**‍**


### **The How**  

The previous sections addressed the “what” or more precisely, the space market through the lens of fair competition and antitrust. However, determining the “how” is more challenging. Indeed, as mentioned, sources of a space antitrust could either originate in future initiatives at the level of hard law or could be left to the realm of soft law and self-regulation. The former surpasses the latter in terms of legitimacy, but might be very time-consuming (75), if reaching consensus at all. The latter might not sit well with the space community at large, but might prove more efficient and timelier, which is needed especially when space commerce beckons.  

To come to grips with the implementation conundrum, this section draws from the legal field of intellectual property, which is considered, according to the Organisation on Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (76), as a part of competition law because of its monopolistic potential. Intellectual property has its share of controversy in terms of knowledge enclosure and excludability of knowledge commons (77), thus arguably reducing the advancement of innovation to the status of stagnation and limiting the diversity of knowledge itself (78). Intellectual property (IP) rights, as any aspects of property law, rely on a State’s jurisdiction. However, when transformed into financial assets, these intangible assets can eventually escape that given jurisdiction (79). Furthermore, as IP increasingly interacts with antitrust (80), it is interesting to note here the junction between property rights, IP, finance, antitrust and space. Through IP, antitrust could find yet another way to escape national legislation and incentivize the growth, at the same time, of a space financial market. In this situation, the content of IP could be space resources  _per se_, however modified somehow in order to qualify for either a patent or trade secrets and translated into financial assets. They could then benefit from innovative and decentralized archiving through technology such as blockchain -- although “consortium blockchains” (81) might raise collusion or concerted practices issues, which qualify as "unfair competition” and enter the realm of smart contracts, which are self-executory by default (82), and increase transparency, while escaping a whole lot of jurisdiction. They could even become a source of space commodities in the case of an eventual space commodities exchange (83). Such opportunity for decentralized governance can perhaps be managed at best through polycentricity, which is based on Ostrom’s matrix of goods (84) trying to solve issues around the “commons” and their respective rights (85). This might prove essential as IP carries an inherent risk of monopolization. In this scenario, entire resource systems, altered to qualify as IP, can be monopolized by a few private entities, which could end up restricting significantly the capacity and diversity of space commerce in the future. Since this kind of assets would fall under the fifth basket of commodities (86), namely financial rights, and in this case, derivatives, it would be trickier to determine the applicable law because of increasing deregulation. Furthermore, this problem is exacerbated by decentralized cyber technology such as blockchain. Hence the bigger problem of identifying the appropriate source of law to intervene in this transnational occurrence.  

Having touched on the pros and cons of hard and soft law,  _supra_, the observation which could be made in this section is that soft law, building on the trend of privatization of the law, could seize this opportunity to play an active role through different instruments such as compliance requirements, contractual clauses, or ethical principles, which often precede law chronologically (87). These private sources of law, and perhaps soon enough public sources too, stem from a potential business model involving platforms that manage decentralized blockchain systems housing the code of financial assets derived from space resources IP -- and arguably creating thus new property rights “from scratch” (88). These platforms could make sure that no set of coded resource systems take over and monopolize the market and enforce their own rules and smart contracts over others (89). Such purpose focused on fair competition could be orchestrated inside a given community of interest (90) and rely on an external entity (oracle form to be determined) for guidance with respect to perpetuating the protection of the given purpose (91). That could take the form of a trust (92) and contribute to laying the foundations for future sustainable customary practice, norms, or behavior. Such trust might indeed address antitrust on the level of the “what” (fair competition and resource systems) and the “how” (fair competition in terms of platforms, i.e., preventing monopolization of one or several blockchains through initial allocations) by enforcing principles such as open access and transparency.

‍  

### **Discussion**

Outer space remains a heavily regulated and strongly politicized sector. However, the growing commercialization of the sector opens the gate to another form of regulation besides the sectoral one. International commercial law, hand in hand with national legislation, fills the gap left by the  _corpus juris spatialis_, however, with opaque transnational and private legal mutations as the ones negotiated behind closed doors, in arbitration, it is difficult to fully anticipate the “soft”  _lex ferenda_, especially when customary norms are being set in motion as of this writing. This note asserts the need to at least anticipate the evolution of competition in the space ecosystem, through the legal lens, and to act on it to ensure fair competition and mitigate the risk of monopolization for the benefit of a sustainable and diversified space economy ahead.

Borrowing from legal design, the knowledge mapping below (Figure 1) summarizes the key principles as enshrined in the  _corpus juris spatialis_  and their potentially beneficial impact as compliance catalysts for fair competition in the commercial space sector. The mind mapping also includes various strategies leading to antitrust solutions such as the thesis of IP.

_Figure 1: Space commerce through the lens of antitrust as a purpose_

In a nutshell, the above figure aims to illustrate the fact that competition law in the space sector is not just about busting monopolies in the launchers sector (93). It can indeed be a lot more than that, and creativity is the limit. In short, the sky is not the limit but only the beginning.

‍

### **Conclusion**

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the hidden power of antitrust into shaping a sustainable space ecosystem in the future and to ensure that space commerce, and hence the emerging  _“lex mercatoria spatialis”_  adheres to the higher principles of international space law. Despite antitrust initially stemming from national law and its challenging international (or lack of) governance and harmonized enforcement, there are many shortcuts, as elaborated throughout this paper, to apply antitrust in the space sector. One such strategy is through anticipating the future nature of the space financial market thanks to decentralized technology seeking to further escape jurisdiction requirements. This implies the need for an adaptive governance based on polycentricity and openness, for the benefit of intergenerational equity and sustainability. Pragmatic ways must indeed be found to preclude further enclosure of knowledge at the interplanetary level, which generate an adverse effect, opposite of economic and innovation growth (94). The next step is to compare governance models and select the most efficient path towards ensuring the perennial protection of space law principles such as benefit sharing, cooperation, equality, freedom of exploration, non-harmful interference, and due regard, applied through the lens of fair competition for a diversified space economy.
