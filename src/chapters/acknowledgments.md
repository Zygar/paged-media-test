### COOK Alliance

The COOK Alliance is a nonprofit whose mission is to establish a just & people-powered home cooking industry. We believe that home restaurants should be legal in the United States. We successfully legalized home cooking in California and would like to bring this same opportunity to home cooks across the nation.
