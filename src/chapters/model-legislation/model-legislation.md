## Definitions

1. HOME COOKING OPERATION means an enterprise in a private home that is operated by a resident of the private home that stores, handles, prepares, packages, serves, and sells or otherwise provides food to consumers. A HOME COOKING OPERATION does not include a food processing plant, food service establishment, temporary food service establishment, caterer, cottage food operation[^1], educational institution, residential group home facility, assisted living facility, or health care facility. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the operator of a HOME COOKING OPERATION from separately operating, or applying for a license or permit to operate, another type of food business in accordance with law.[^2]
2. ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE means an entity that provides a platform on its internet website or mobile application through which a HOME COOKING OPERATION may choose to offer food for sale and from which the ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE derives revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from advertising and fees for services offered to a HOME COOKING OPERATION. Services offered by an ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE to a HOME COOKING OPERATION may include, but are not limited to, allowing a HOME COOKING OPERATION to advertise its food for sale and providing a means for potential CONSUMERS to arrange payment for the food, whether the CONSUMER pays directly to the HOME COOKING OPERATION or to the ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE. Merely publishing an advertisement for the HOME COOKING OPERATION or food cooked therein does not make the publisher an ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE.
3. READY-TO-EAT FOOD means food that is in a form that is edible and safe to eat without washing, cooking or additional preparation by the consumer and that is reasonably expected to be consumed in the form in which it is provided to the consumer or after reheating by the consumer.
4. REGULATORY AUTHORITY[^3] means the state or local jurisdiction, such as the county, having jurisdiction over HOME COOKING OPERATIONS.
5. STATE AGENCY[^4] means the government agency at the state level with jurisdiction over HOME COOKING OPERATIONS.

## Home Cooking Operations

1. A HOME COOKING OPERATION[^5] may not produce: 
    1. food containing raw shellfish;

    3. raw milk or raw milk products; or 
    4. any low-acid canned food or acidified food that requires a scheduled process under applicable federal, state or local law.
2. A HOME COOKING OPERATION may sell or otherwise provide food directly to consumers only, and not to any food reseller.  A HOME COOKING OPERATION may sell food to consumers in person at the operator’s home or other location, such as a farmers’ market, or remotely by telephone, email or internet website, including through an ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACE or mobile application.
3. All food sold and otherwise provided to consumers by the HOME COOKING OPERATION shall be READY-TO-EAT FOOD. 
4. FOOD shall be prepared, cooked, and served or picked up or delivered within a safe time period based on holding equipment capacity. Food from a HOME COOKING OPERATION may be delivered to consumers by the operator, by an employee or agent of the operator, or by a THIRD-PARTY DELIVERY SERVICE.

## Enforcement

1. After the initial inspection for purposes of determining permit eligibility, a HOME COOKING OPERATION shall be subject to inspections only in the following three circumstances:
    1. Not more than once in any twelve-month period, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY may conduct a routine inspection for the purpose of observing the operator engaged in the usual activities of a HOME COOKING OPERATION, including, but not limited to, active food preparation. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall provide notice to the permit holder before a routine inspection and shall conduct the routine inspection at a mutually agreeable date and time. This paragraph shall not be deemed to require the REGULATORY AUTHORITY to conduct a routine inspection.
    2. A for-cause inspection may be conducted when the REGULATORY AUTHORITY has a valid reason, such as a credible consumer complaint, to suspect that adulterated or otherwise unsafe food has been produced by the HOME COOKING OPERATION or that the HOME COOKING OPERATION has otherwise been in  violation of this chapter. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall provide notice to an operator before conducting a for-cause inspection and shall conduct the inspection at a mutually agreeable date and time.
    3. If the REGULATORY AUTHORITY has just cause to believe that the HOME COOKING OPERATION poses a serious hazard or immediate threat to public health, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY may conduct an emergency inspection that is limited to the facts prompting the inspection. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall provide the operator with advance notice of an emergency inspection to the extent that it is reasonable to do so under the circumstances.
2. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY may inspect only the permitted area of the HOME COOKING OPERATION for the purpose of enforcing or administering this chapter. 
3. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY may decline to grant a new permit, may decline to renew a permit, and may suspend or revoke a permit already granted after due notice and opportunity for hearing whenever it finds that:
    1. Any statement contained in an application for a permit is or was false or misleading;
    2. The HOME COOKING OPERATION does not have facilities or equipment sufficient to maintain adequate sanitation for the activities conducted;
    3. The HOME COOKING OPERATION is not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition or is not operated in a sanitary manner;   
    4.  The maintenance and operation of the HOME COOKING OPERATION is such that the food produced therein is or may be adulterated;  
    5. The HOME COOKING OPERATION has failed or refused to produce any records or provide any information demanded by the REGULATORY AUTHORITY reasonably related to the administration and enforcement of this chapter; or
    6. The HOME COOKING OPERATION has failed to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and except in circumstances posing an imminent, serious risk to public health, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall issue a warning letter or notice of violation to any person it finds to be in violation of this chapter or the regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, and provide the alleged violator a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation, before the REGULATORY AUTHORITY seeks an administrative remedy or penalty. Agency and local authority enforcement powers shall be limited to investigations, inspections, warnings, and restrictions, suspensions or revocations of a permit.[^6]

## Regulations



1. By no later than **[[DATE]]**, the STATE AGENCY shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement this chapter.  Such rules and regulations may include provisions relating to permitting of HOME COOKING OPERATIONS, hygiene, sanitation, approved sources of food, training and recordkeeping.[^8]

3. Regulations adopted by the STATE AGENCY may require that HOME COOKING OPERATIONs comply with sanitation regulations applicable to retail food establishments[^9], provided that HOME COOKING OPERATIONs shall be exempt from any requirements that do not meet the criteria of subdivision two of this section or that otherwise conflict with this chapter.
4. The regulations adopted by the STATE AGENCY shall not require that any person working in a HOME COOKING OPERATION obtain food safety training and certification beyond food handler training and certification; provided that, food protection manager training and certification also shall satisfy the food safety training requirements. The STATE AGENCY shall ensure that the required training content and any required examination are available in languages other than English that are commonly spoken by state residents as their primary language.


## Local Law

1. A county, city, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state  shall not require a HOME COOKING OPERATION to comply with requirements that are different from, or in addition to, the requirements of this chapter and the regulations promulgated pursuant to it.

To promote regulatory and compliance transparency, the REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall collect and publicly report on an annual basis aggregate data on the number of HOME COOKING OPERATION permit applications received, the number of HOME COOKING OPERATION permits issued, the numbers and types of violations found by the REGULATORY AUTHORITY in enforcing this chapter and the regulations promulgated pursuant to it, and the numbers and types of enforcement actions taken by the REGULATORY AUTHORITY to enforce this chapter and the regulations promulgated pursuant to it. 
2. The REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall maintain a publicly available electronic list of all registered ONLINE FOOD MARKETPLACES and the business name, permit numbers, and city location of all open and permitted HOME COOKING OPERATIONS


## Conforming Amendments

[CITATION TO STATUTE DEFINING A TYPE OF FOOD BUSINESS -- E.G., FOOD PROCESSING PLANT, RETAIL FOOD ESTABLISHMENT] is amended to read as follows:

[TEXT OF THE CURRENT DEFINITION.] The term does not include a HOME COOKING OPERATION that has received a permit from the REGULATORY AUTHORITY under [CITATION TO THIS STATUTE].


[^1]: The terminology used in this provision to exclude certain types of operations and facilities from the definition of HOME COOKING OPERATION may need to be revised to match the names used in applicable state law for these types of operations/facilities.

[^2]:] Regulations around cottage food and catering vary from state to state. Some states are choosing to consolidate the number of home-based business under 1 permit. Consider how these three different businesses work together.

[^3]: Replace "regulatory authority" with the term used in relevant state law for the agency(ies) that will be primarily responsible for inspections and permitting, which may be local health departments or a state department of health or agriculture.

[^4]: Replace "state agency" with the term used to refer to the state-level agency that will have overall responsibility for this program and will promulgate the governing regulations

[^5]: "A state may choose to limit the activities of the Home Cooking Operation through placing restrictions on the number of meals prepared or customers served per day, the number of meals prepared or customers served per week, or the amount of revenue made in a year. States should ensure that home cooks can make a living wage regardless of the cap put in place. One possible formula is: Livable wage for the state * 2 (because of the 50% margins in food) + $5,000 for overhead (permits, insurance, etc) = cap. States might also choose to limit the number of employees a Home Cooking Operation can have."

[^6]: Existing state law provides state and local authorities with enforcement powers, authorizes remedies and penalties for violations of laws within the agencies' jurisdiction (such as administrative orders, court injunctions, and criminal penalties), and sets out the process by which remedies and penalties may be imposed. Those enforcement and penalty provisions likely will apply to Home Cooking Operations unless this statute specifically exempts Home Cooking Operations from the usual enforcement mechanisms.

[^7]: This is an example footnote that will appear in the margins on the website. 

[^8]: See the Home Cooking Operations Model Code for an example you can adapt for your state.

[^9]: Change "retail food establishment," as needed, to whatever term is used in the state's law (or a citation) to refer to the regulations applicable to restaurants or retail food stores. In most states, these regulations are based on or incorporate by reference FDA's model Food Code.
