# Food Safety


## FOOD Shall Be Safe, unADULTERATED, and Honestly Presented

1. FOOD shall be offered for human consumption in a way that does not mislead or misinform the CONSUMER.
2. FOOD or COLOR ADDITIVES, colored overwraps, or lights may not be used to misrepresent the true appearance, color, or quality of a FOOD.
3. FOOD shall be protected from contamination that may result from the addition of unsafe or unapproved FOOD or color additives or unsafe or unapproved levels of approved FOOD and color additives.
4. FOOD EMPLOYEES may not apply sulfiting agents to fresh fruits and vegetables intended for raw consumption, or to any potentially hazardous FOOD.


## FOOD that Requires a HACCP Plan May Not Be Prepared

1. As per § 2-1(H), FOOD preparation must not involve processes that require a hazardous analysis and critical control (HACCP) plan.


## FOOD SOURCES

1. FOOD shall be obtained from sources that comply with LAW and that are permitted for commercial sale, except that the PERMIT HOLDER may: 
    1. Source fruits and vegetables from their own home garden provided the FOOD has been grown, harvested, and stored in a manner that will not endanger the public nor risk FOODborne illness.
    2. Use foraged FOODs, provided the PERMIT HOLDER has the requisite knowledge to safely forage FOOD and the FOOD is labeled in accordance with § 5-1(B).  
    3. Use wild GAME ANIMALS, if hunted and prepared in accordance with the LAW. 


## EGGS

1. EGGS must be clean, sound, and uncracked. 
2. EGGS may be harvested from the PERMIT HOLDER’s own chicken, turkey, duck, or quail provided that the animals are raised in accordance with LAW and handled in a manner as to prevent FOODborne illness. 
3. Only pasteurized EGGS or EGG PRODUCTS shall be used in the preparation of FOODS such as Caesar salad, hollandaise or Béarnaise sauce, mayonnaise, meringue, eggnog, ice cream, and EGG-fortified BEVERAGES that are not fully cooked.
4. EGGS and EGG PRODUCTS shall be stored in refrigerated EQUIPMENT that maintains an ambient air temperature of 7°C (45°F) or less.

## Preventing Contamination from Hands

1. COOKS shall wash their hands as specified in this Code.
2. Single-use gloves shall be worn when contacting FOOD and FOOD-CONTACT surfaces if the COOK has any cuts, sores, rashes, artificial nails, nail polish, rings (other than a plain ring, such as a wedding band), uncleanable orthopedic support devices, or fingernails that are not clean, smooth, and neatly trimmed. 
3. Whenever single-use gloves are worn, they shall be changed or replaced as often as handwashing is required by this part. Single-use gloves shall not be washed. 
4. If used by a COOK, single-use gloves shall be used for only one task, such as working with ready-to-eat FOOD or with raw FOOD of animal origin, shall be used for no other purpose, and shall be discarded when damaged or soiled or when interruptions in the FOOD handling occur. 
5. COOKS shall minimize bare hand and arm contact with exposed FOOD that is not in a READY-TO-EAT form.
6. Cloth gloves and slash-resistant gloves used to protect hands during cutting may not be used in direct contact with FOOD unless the FOOD is subsequently cooked as required by this Code.


## Preventing Contamination with UTENSILS

1. A COOK may not use a UTENSIL more than once to taste FOOD that is to be sold or served.
2. When serving FOOD either dine-in or when putting FOOD into containers for take-out, the serving UTENSILS should not be cross contaminated with other FOOD sources, such as using the same UTENSILS to serve mac and cheese and salad. 


## Preventing FOOD and Ingredient Contamination

1. FOOD packages that are purchased for use in the HOME COOKING OPERATION shall be in good condition and protect the integrity of the contents so that the FOOD is not exposed to ADULTERATION or potential contaminants.
2. FOOD shall be protected from cross contamination by:
    1. Separating raw animal FOODS during storage, preparation, holding, and display from cooked READY-TO-EAT FOOD and fruits and vegetables before they are washed, except that frozen, commercially processed and PACKAGED raw animal FOOD may be stored or displayed with or above frozen, commercially processed and PACKAGED, READY-TO-EAT FOOD.
    2. Except when combined as ingredients, separating types of raw animal FOODS from each other such as beef, FISH, lamb, pork, and POULTRY during storage, preparation, holding, and display by:
        1. Using separate EQUIPMENT for each type; or
        2. Arranging each type of FOOD in EQUIPMENT so that cross contamination of one type with another is prevented; and
        3. Preparing each type of FOOD at different times or in separate areas.
    3. Cleaning EQUIPMENT and UTENSILS as specified in this Code.
    4. Except as otherwise specifically allowed, storing the FOOD in packages, covered containers, or wrappings.
    5. Cleaning HERMETICALLY SEALED CONTAINERS of  FOOD of visible soil before opening.
    6. Segregating and storing damaged, spoiled, or recalled FOOD being held in the HOME COOKING OPERATION in designated areas separate from the HOME COOKING OPERATION operations.

## Protecting Fruits and Vegetables from Contamination

1. Raw fruits and vegetables shall be thoroughly washed in water to remove soil and other contaminants before being cut, combined with other ingredients, cooked, served, or offered for human consumption in READY-TO-EAT form, except: 
    1. Whole, uncut, raw fruits and vegetables that are intended for washing by the CONSUMER before consumption; and
    2. Whole, uncut, raw fruits and vegetables and nuts in the shell, that require peeling or hulling before consumption.
2. Chemicals used to wash or peel raw, whole fruits and vegetables or used in the treatment, storage, and processing of fruits and vegetables shall keep the FOOD and CONSUMER safe, such as being generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for this intended use or be an approved FOOD additive listed for this use in 21 CFR 173.


## Reduced Oxygen Packaging Prohibited

1. FOOD prepared by a HOME COOKING OPERATION for take-out or delivery shall be individually packaged to maintain FOOD safety and integrity, but in no instance using reduced oxygen packaging methods. Further, HOME COOKING OPERATIONS may only use reduced oxygen packaging FOOD that was made by a licensed commercial operation.
    1. For the purposes of this section, “reduced oxygen packaging” is defined as removing oxygen from a package, displacing and replacing oxygen with another gas or combination of gases, or controlling the oxygen content to a level that is below what is normally found in the surrounding atmosphere.
    2. For purposes of this subsection (1), “reduced oxygen packaging” includes:
        1. “vacuum packaging,” in which air is removed from a package of FOOD and the package is hermetically sealed so that a vacuum remains inside the package,
        2. “modified atmosphere packaging,” in which the proportion of air in a package is reduced, the oxygen is totally replaced, or when the proportion of other gases such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen are increased,
        3. “canning” in which FOOD is heat processed and sealed in an airtight can or similar container,
        4. “controlled atmosphere packaging,” in which the atmosphere of a packaged commodity is modified so that until the package is opened, its composition is different from air, and continuous control of that atmosphere is maintained, such as by using oxygen scavengers or a combination of total replacement of oxygen, non-respiring FOOD, and impermeable packaging material,
        5. “cook-chill packaging,” in which cooked FOOD is hot filled into impermeable bags that have the air expelled and are then sealed or crimped closed and then chilled or refrigerated at temperatures that inhibit the growth of pathogens of public health significance; and
        6. “sous vide packaging,” in which raw or partially cooked FOOD is placed in a hermetically sealed, impermeable bag, cooked in the bag, rapidly chilled, and refrigerated at temperatures that inhibit the growth of pathogens of public health significance.


## Preventing Contamination from Ice 

1. Ice for use as a FOOD or a cooling medium shall be made from drinking water.
2. Ice used as FOOD may not have any other uses prior to its use as FOOD, such as cooling canned beverages. 
3. PACKAGED FOOD may not be stored in direct contact with ice or water if the FOOD is subject to the entry of water because of the nature of its packaging, wrapping, or container or its positioning in the ice or water.
4. UnPACKAGED FOOD may not be stored in direct contact with undrained ice, except that  whole, raw fruits or vegetables; cut, raw vegetables such as celery or carrot sticks or cut potatoes; and tofu may be immersed in ice or water.


## Preventing Contamination from EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, and LINENS 

1. FOOD shall only contact surfaces of:
    1. EQUIPMENT and UTENSILS that are cleaned and SANITIZED as specified under § 6-(5-7); 
    2. SINGLE-SERVICE and SINGLE-USE ARTICLES; and
    3. Cleaned LINENS.


## Preventing Contamination from the Premises 

1. Except as specified in (C) of this section, FOOD shall be protected from contamination by storing the FOOD:
    1. In a clean, dry location; and
    2. Where it is not exposed to splash, dust, or other contamination.
2. Except as specified in (C) of this section, FOOD may not be stored:
    1. Directly on the floor, unless in a sealable container; provided, however, that even if FOOD is in a sealable container, it must not be stored in the following locations: 
        1. In toilet rooms;
        2. In dressing rooms;
        3. In garbage rooms;
        4. In mechanical rooms;
        5. Under open stairwells; or
        6. Under other sources of contamination.
3. Pressurized BEVERAGE containers, cased FOOD in waterproof containers such as bottles or cans, and milk containers in plastic crates may be stored on a floor that is clean and not exposed to floor moisture.
4. During preparation, unPACKAGED FOOD shall be protected from environmental sources of contamination.


## Preventing Contamination by Consumers

1. Condiments shall be protected from contamination by being kept in:
    1. dispensers that are designed to provide protection; or
    2. protected FOOD displays provided with the proper UTENSILS; or
    3. original containers designed for dispensing; or
    4. individual PACKAGES or portions.


## Returned FOOD and Re-Service of FOOD

1. Except as specified in (B) of this section, after being served or sold and in the possession of a CONSUMER, FOOD that is unused or returned by the CONSUMER may not be offered as FOOD for resale. 
2. A container of FOOD that is not TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED FOR SAFETY FOOD may be RE­ SERVED from one CONSUMER to another if:
    1. The FOOD is dispensed so that it is protected from contamination and the container is closed between uses, such as a narrow-neck bottle containing catsup, steak sauce, or wine; or
    2. The FOOD, such as crackers, salt, or pepper, is in an unopened original PACKAGE and is maintained in sound condition.


## Destruction of Organisms of Public Health Concern in Raw Animal Foods 

1. FISH, that are intended for consumption in raw or undercooked form, may be offered for sale or service if they are obtained from a supplier or from a permit-holder who freezes the FISH according to LAW.
2. Raw animal FOODS such as EGGS, FISH, MEAT, POULTRY, and FOODS containing these raw animal FOODS, shall be cooked to heat all parts of the FOOD to a temperature and for a time that ensures the safety of the FOOD for consumption.
3. Raw animal FOODS cooked in a microwave oven shall be:
    1. Rotated or stirred throughout or midway during cooking to compensate for uneven distribution of heat;
    2. Covered to retain surface moisture;
    3. Heated to a temperature that ensures the safety of the FOOD for consumption; and 
    4. Allowed to stand covered for 2 minutes after cooking to obtain temperature equilibrium.


## Reheating for Hot Holding 

1. FOOD cooked, cooled, and reheated for hot holding must reach temperatures that ensure the safety of consumption. 
2. Once FOOD is removed from a refrigerator, it must be reheated promptly and in no case can it sit outside of temperature control, such as above 41°F, for 2 hours or more before being reheated for consumption.


## Limitations of Growth of Organisms of Public Health Concern During Heating and Cooling 

1. Stored frozen FOODS shall be maintained frozen.
2. Frozen TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD that is being SLACKED shall be held during the slacking process:
    1. Under refrigeration that maintains the FOOD temperature at 5°C (41°F) or less; or
    2. Outside of refrigeration, as long as the FOOD remains frozen.
3. TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD shall be thawed:
    1. Under refrigeration that maintains the FOOD temperature at 5°C (41°F) or less; or
    2. Completely submerged under  water that is maintained cold and maintains the FOOD temperature at 41°F or less; or
    3. In a microwave, while ensuring the temperature is evenly distributed throughout the FOOD, such as by rotating, stirring, allowing the FOOD to stand covered for 2 minutes after defrosting.
4. TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD must be cooked within 2 hours of being completely thawed, unless immediately refrigerated. 
5. Cooked TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD shall be cooled as promptly as possible, but in no case later than:
    1. 2 hours from 57°C (135°F) to 21°C (70°F); and
    2. a total of 6 hours from 57°C (135°F) to 5°C (41°F).
6. TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD prepared from ingredients at ambient temperature shall be cooled within 4 hours to 5°C (41°F) or less.
7. The FOOD must be protected from contamination during the cooling process.


## Limitations of Growth of Organisms of Public Health Concern While FOOD is Maintained Hot or Cold 

1. TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD that is being held shall be maintained:
    1. At 57°C (135°F) or above; or
    2. At 5°C (41°F) or less.
2. Time without temperature control may be used as the public health control up to a maximum of 4 hours only if the following conditions are met:
    1. The FOOD shall have an initial temperature of 5°C (41°F) or less when removed from cold holding temperature control, or 57°C (135°F) or greater when removed from hot holding temperature control; 
    2. The FOOD shall be marked or otherwise identified to indicate the time that is 4 hours past the point in time when the FOOD is removed from temperature control; and
    3. The FOOD shall be cooked and served, served at any temperature if READY-TO-EAT, or discarded, within 4 hours from the point in time when the FOOD is removed from temperature control.
3. A HOME COOKING OPERATION  that serves a HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATION may not use time as specified in this section as the public health control for raw EGGS or undercooked products of animal origin.


## Discarding or Reconditioning Unsafe, Adulterated, or Contaminated FOOD

1. A FOOD that is unsafe, ADULTERATED, or not honestly presented shall be discarded. 
2. FOOD that is not from an APPROVED source shall be discarded.
3. FOOD that may have been contaminated by FOOD EMPLOYEES, CONSUMERS, or other persons through contact with their hands, bodily discharges, such as nasal or oral discharges, or other means shall be discarded.
4. FOOD may be relabeled or cured to ensure its safety and compliance with LAW.


## Lawful Food Donation 

1. The practice of donating surplus food to another party, for ultimate distribution to needy individuals, is a lawful practice for a HOME COOKING OPERATION.
