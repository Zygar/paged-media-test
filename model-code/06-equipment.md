4. All FOOD CONTACT SURFACES, EQUIPMENT, and UTENSILS, such as cutting boards and non-stick pans, must be in good repair and condition so as to be effectively cleaned and sanitized. When they no longer meet the requirements listed above due to wear and tear or scratches, they must be discarded or replaced.
5. If it is or becomes impossible to wash and sanitize EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, FOOD CONTACT SURFACES per the requirements in this chapter, COOKS must use only SINGLE-USE UTENSILS and SINGLE SERVICE articles that meet the requirements in § 6-1(F).
6. SINGLE SERVICE and SINGLE USE articles must be safe for their intended use and may not be re-used.
7. If sponges are used, the COOKS shall:
    1. replace them regularly;
    2. SANITIZE them often;
    3. not use sponges on SANITIZED surfaces; and 
    4. use sponges to clean utensils only if the utensils will be SANITIZED after.
8. Non-FOOD CONTACT SURFACES in the kitchen that are involved in or adjacent to HOME COOKING OPERATION must be easily cleanable and must be kept clean and sanitized.
9. All EQUIPMENT (including, but not limited to, ventilation systems and barbecues) must be EASILY CLEANABLE (including removing component parts to be cleaned and/or replaced), and must be kept clean.

1. Cleaned and SANITIZED EQUIPMENT and UTENSILS, and FOOD, may not be located:
    1. In toilet rooms;
    2. In garbage rooms;
    3. In mechanical rooms; or
    4. Under other sources of contamination.


## TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICES 

1. A TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICE shall be present in the refrigerator or freezer and also in the kitchen (to be used to measure the heat of cooked meat). 
2. FOOD TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICES may not have sensors or stems constructed of glass, except that thermometers with glass sensors or stems that are encased in a shatterproof coating, such as candy thermometers, may be used. 
3. FOOD TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICES shall be accurate to ±2◦F in the intended range of use.

## Hot and Cold Holding 

1. A TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICE shall be present in the refrigerator or freezer and also in the kitchen (to be used to measure the heat of cooked meat). 
2. FOOD TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICES may not have sensors or stems.


## Cleaning of EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, FOOD-CONTACT SURFACES, and NON-FOOD CONTACT SURFACES 

1. EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, FOOD-CONTACT SURFACES, and NON-FOOD CONTACT SURFACES shall be clean to sight and touch, such as being free of dust, dirt, FOOD residue, grease accumulation, or other potential sources of contamination.
2. Unless otherwise specified, all EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, FOOD-CONTACT SURFACES, and NON-FOOD CONTACT SURFACES shall be washed and sanitized prior to and throughout the HOME COOKING OPERATIONS, as necessary.
3. EQUIPMENT, FOOD-CONTACT SURFACES and UTENSILS shall be cleaned and sanitized:
    1. Before each use with a different type of raw animal FOOD such as beef, FISH, lamb, pork, or POULTRY; 
    2. Each time there is a change from working with raw FOODS to working with READY-TO-EAT FOODS; 
    3. Between uses with raw fruits and vegetables and with TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY FOOD; 
    4. Before using or storing a FOOD TEMPERATURE MEASURING DEVICE; 
    5. At any time during the operation when contamination may have occurred; and,
    6. At any other time necessary to preclude accumulation of soil residues, FOOD residues, or other residues. The cleaning schedule is based on:
        1. The type of FOOD involved,
        2. The amount of FOOD residue accumulation, and
        3. The temperature at which the FOOD is maintained during the operation and the potential for the rapid and progressive multiplication of pathogenic or toxigenic microorganisms that are capable of causing FOODborne disease; or
4. If in-use UTENSILS are intermittently stored in a container of water, the water must be maintained at 57◦C (135◦F) or more and must be placed in the water a frequency necessary to preclude accumulation of soil residues.
5. Sinks must be cleaned and sanitized between uses, such as between handwashing, thawing FOOD, or washing produce. 
6. HOME COOKING OPERATIONS shall maintain adequate supplies of cleaning supplies, such as cleaning agents, disinfectants, and soap. 


## WAREWASHING machine
