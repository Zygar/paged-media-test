    5. To the extent applicable, the following disclosures:
        1. Foraged FOODs shall be labeled “wild harvested FOOD, not inspected by [state] department of [agriculture].”
        2. Unpasteurized juices that have been made in and by the HOME COOKING OPERATION must be prominently and conspicuously labeled with the following, “WARNING: This product has not been pasteurized and, therefore, may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.”
        3. Raw or undercooked FOODS of animal origin disclosure shall be labeled with a disclosure:
            1. Consuming raw or undercooked MEATS, POULTRY, seafood, shellfish, or EGGS may increase your RISK of FOODborne illness, especially if you have certain medical conditions.
